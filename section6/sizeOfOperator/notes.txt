sizeof determines thee size in bytes of a type or variable

e.g.
  sizeof(int)
  sizeof(double)

  sizeof(some_variable)
  sizeof some_variable

sizeof operator gets its information from 2 C++ include file:
  
  <climits> //this one is for integer types
  <cfloar>  //this one is for floating types

Some of the things that these include files have are:

  INT_MAX
  INT_MIN
  LONG_MAX
  LONG_MIN
  FLT_MAX
  FLT_MIN
