Move assignment operato (=)

  -You can choose to overload the move assignment operator
    -C++ will use the copy assignment operator if necessary

    Mystring s1;
    s1 = Mystring{"Frank"}; //move assignment

  -If we have raw pointer we should overload the move assignment operator for efficiency

----------------------------------------------------------------
Overloading the move assignment operator
  
  Type &Type::operator=(Type &&rhs);
  
  Mystring &Mystring::operator=(Mystring &&rhs);

  s1 = Mystring{"Joe}; //move operator= called
  s1 = "Frank"; //move operator= called

----------------------------------------------------------------
-Check for self assignment
  if(this == &rhs)
    return *this; //return current object

-Deallocate storage for this->str since we are overwriting it
  delete[] str;

-Steal the pointer from the rhs object and assign it to this->str
  str = rhs.str;

-Null out the rhs pointer
  rhs.str = nullptr;

-Return the current object by reference to allow chain assignment
  return *this;
