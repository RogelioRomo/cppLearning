With sequence, selection and iteration we can resolve and create any algorithm

Sequence: ordering statements sequentially

Selection: making decisions
  if statement
  if-else statements
  Nested if statements
  swittch statements
  Conditional operator ?:

Iteration: looping or repeating
  for loop
  ranged-based for loop
  while loop
  do-while loop
  continue and break
  infinite loops
  nested loops
