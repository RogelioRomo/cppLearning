Exercise: Find the first vowel in a vector

Specification:
Write a C++ program that uses a do-while loop to find the first English vowel in a hard-coded std::vector of characters. The vector should contain a mixture of vowels and consonants (for example: {'h', 'e', 'l', 'l', 'o'})
The program should print the first vowel found in the vector. If no vowel is found, it should print a message indicating that no vowel was found.

Instructions:
You will be writing your code within the provided function find_first_vowel(const std::vector<char>& vec). Do not change the function name or its parameter.

Do-while loop: utilize a do-while loop to iterate through the characters in the provided std::vector<char> named vec.

Vowel identification: In each iteration, check if the current character is a lowercase English vowel (a e i o u)

Output:
If a vowel is found, use cout to display: "Vowel found: " followed by the vowel.

If no vowel is found in the entire vector, display: "No vowel was found".

Examples: here are some sample vector and the expected output

For vector {'f', 'r', 'a', 'n', 'k'}, your function should output: Vowel found: a
For vector {'F', 'R', 'A', 'N', 'K'}, your function should output: No vowel was found
For an empty vector {}, your function should output: No vowel was found
