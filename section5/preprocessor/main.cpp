/*
 *The C++ preprocessor is a program that process your source code before the
 compiler sees it. The C++ preprocessor first strips all the comments from the
 source file and replaces each comment with a single space

 Then it looks for preprocessor directives and executes them. These directives
 are lines in the source code that egin with a pound/hashtag (#)

 Important to say that the C++ preprocessor does NOT understand C++. It simply
 follows the preprocessor directives and gets the source code ready for the
 compiler which is the one that understands C++
