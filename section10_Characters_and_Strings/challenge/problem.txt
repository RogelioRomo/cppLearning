A simple and very old method of sending secret messages is the substitution cipher. You might have used this cipher with your frienfs when you were a kid.
Basically, each letter of the alphabet gets replaced by another letter of the alphabet. For example, every 'a' gets replaced with an 'X', and every 'b' gets replaced with a 'Z', etc.

Write a program that asks the user to enter a secret message

Encrypt this message using the substitution cipher and display the encrypted message. Then decrypt the encrypted message back to the original message

You may use the 2 string below for your substitution. For example, to encrypt you can replace the character at position 'n' in alphabet with the character at position 'n' in key

To decrypt you can replace the character at position 'n' in key with the character at position 'n' in alphabet
