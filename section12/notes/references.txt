What is a reference?

  -An alias for a variable
  -Must be initialized to a variable when declared 
  -Cannot be null
  -Once initialized cannot be made to refer to a different variable
  -Very useful as function parameters
  -Might be helpful to think of a reference as a constant pointer that is automatically
  dereferenced

Using references in range-based for loop

  Without reference:
    vector<string> stooges{"Larry", "Moe", "Curly"};
    for(auto str: stooges)
      str = "Funny"; //changes the copy

    for(auto str: stooges)
      cout << str << endl;  //Larry, Moe, Curly


  Using reference:
    vector<string> stooges{"Larry", "Moe", "Curly"};
    for(auto &str: stooges) //reference
      str = "Funny"; //changes the actual vector

    for(auto str: stooges)
      cout << str << endl; //Funny, Funny, Funny
