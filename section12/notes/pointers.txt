What is a pointer?
  -A variable
    -whose value is an address

  -What can be that address?
    -Another variable
    -A function

  -Pointers point to variables or functions?

  -If x is an integer variable and its value is 10 then I can declare a
  pointer that points to it

  -To use the data that the pointer is pointing to you must know its type

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Why use pointers?
  Can't I just use the variable or function itself?
  Yes, but not always

  -Inside functions, pointer can be used to access data that are defined outside the function.  Those variables may not be in scope so you can"t access them by their name
  
  -Pointer can be used to operate on arrays very efficiently
  
  -We can allocate memory dynamically on the heap or free store
    -This memory doesn't even have a variable name
    -The only way to get to it is via a pointer

  -With 00. pointers are how polymorphism works!
  
  -Can access specific addresses in memory
    -Useful in embedded and systems applications

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Declaring pointers
  e.g.
    variable_type *pointer_name;
    
    int *int_ptr;
    double* double_ptr; //note the position of *
    char *char_ptr;
    string *string_ptr;

Before using pointers is very important to initialize them to avoid
garbage data. That in the case of a pointer is an address so in other words;
without initializing you are telling the pointer to point anywhere.

In the next example we initialize the pointer to point "nowhere" (nullptr).
This help us to avoid pointing to an address that already has data in it:

  e.g.
    variable_type "pointer_name (nullptr};
    int *int_ptr {};
    double* double_ptr {nullptr};
    char *char_ptr {nullptr};
    string *string_ptr {nullptr};

Summarizing:
  -Always initialize pointers
  -Unitialized pointer contain garbage data and can "point anywhere"
  -Initializing to zero or nuliptr(C++ 11) represents address zero
  -Implies that the pointer is "pointing nowhere"
  -If you don't initialize a pointer to point to a variable or function then
  you should initialize it to nullptr to "make it null"
