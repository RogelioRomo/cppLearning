    -The class being created from the Base class
    -Will inherit attributs and operations from Base class

----------------------------------------------------------

  -"Is-A" relationship
    -Public inheritance-derived classes are subtypes of their Base classes
    -Derived classes are sub-type of their base classes
    -Can use a derived class object wherever we use a base class object

  -Generalization
    -Combining similar classes into a single, more general class based on common attributes

  -Specialization
    -Creating new classes from existing classes proving more specialized attributes or operations

  -Inheritance or Class Hierarchies
    -Organization of our inheritance relationships
