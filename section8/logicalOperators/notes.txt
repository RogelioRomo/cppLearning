  not | !  | negation
  and | && | logical and
  or  | || | logical or

  Precedence:
    ! has higher precedence than &&
    && has higher precedence than ||

    ! is a unary operator
    && and || are binary operators

  Examples:
    num1 >= 10 && num1 < 20
    num1 <= 10 || num1 >= 10

    !is_raining && temperatures > 32.0
    is_raining || is_snowing

    temeratures > 100 && is_humid || is_raining

  Short-circuit evaluation:
    When evaluating a logical expression C++ stops as soon as the result is known
    Suppose:
      expr1 && expr2 && expr3 //if expr1 is false than the entire expression is false by default, and C++ will not compute the remaining bacause it knows this
      expr1 || expr2 || expr3 //is any of the expr is true, then the entire expression is true, so no point computing the rest of the sentence
