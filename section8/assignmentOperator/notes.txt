Common operators in C++ can be grouped as follows:
  assignment
  arithmetic
  increment/decrement
  relational
  logical
  member access
  other

--------------------------------------------------
Assignment operator (=). When you change a value that already exists in a variable
  
  lhs = rhs

rhs is an expression that is evaluated to a value
The value of rhs is stored to lhs
The value of rhs must be type compatible with lhs
The lhs must be assignable
Assignment expression it evaluates to what was just assigned
More than one variable can be assigned in a single statement
