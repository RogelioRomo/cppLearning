How do function calls work?

Functions use the 'function call stack'
  -Analogous to a stack of books
  -LIFO - Last in First Out
  -push and pop

Stack frame or activation record
  -Functions must return control to functin that called it
  -Each time a function is called we create a new activation record and push it on stack
  -When a function terminates we pop the activation record and return
  -Local variables and functions parameters are allocated on the stack

Stack size is finite 
  -Stack overflow can happen when we run out of memory on the stack
