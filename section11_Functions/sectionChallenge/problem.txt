Recall challinge from section 9 below
Your challenge for section 11 is to modularize your solution to the section 9 challenge by refactoring your solution so that it uses functions.

You decide how to modularize the program
You can use mysolution which is included in this file, or modularize your solution

Here are a few hints:
  -Create functions for each major function
  -Keep the functions small
  -Remember the boss/worker analogy
  -Keep the vector declaration in the main function pass the vector objext to any function that requires it

  DO NOT move the vector object outside main and make it global variable

  -You can start by defining a function that displays the menu
  -You can then define a function that reads the selection from the user and returns it in uppercase
  -Create functions for each menu option
  -Create functions that display the list of numbers, calculates the mean an so forth

Take it one function at a time and take your time 
Dont forget to use prototypes
