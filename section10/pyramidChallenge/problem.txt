Write a C++ program that displays a letter Pyramid from a user-provided std::string
Prompt the user to enter a std::string and then from that string display a letter Pyramid as follows:

It's much easier to understand the Pyramid fiven examples
If the user enter the string "ABC", then your program should display:

  A
 ABA
ABCBA

If the user enters the string, "12345", then your program should display:

    1
   121
  12321
 1234321
123454321

If the user enters "C++isFun!", then your program should display:

        C
       C+C
      C+++C
     C++i++C
    C++isi++C
   C++isFsi++C
  C++isFuFsi++C
 C++isFunuFsi++C
C++isFun!nuFsi++C

Think about the problem before your begin and break it down into steps
This can be a very challenging problem to solve!
Have fun!
