Arrays by default have fixed sizes meaning that once an array size its declared the program cannot resize it, you would need to go back and manually change the size

The elements of the array need to be all of the same type
Stored contiguosly in memory
No checking to see if you are out of bounds (this means even if you have an array with 5 integers, and you ask about the 10 index, it will return a garbage value)
Always initialize your arrays

Arrays are declared in the next way:
  
  element_type array_name [constan number of elements] {initial value};
  e.g.
    int test_scores [5] {100, 95}; // all the remaining values/indexes would be 0

Accesing array elements (works either for reading or assigning values):
  
  array_name[element_index];
  e.g.
    test_scores[1];

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Multidimensional arrays

  element_type array_name [dim1_size][dim2_size];
  e.g.
    int movie_rating[3][4];

  In the example of a matrix:
    int movie_ratings[rows][cols];
    int movie_rating[3][4] (remember we declare the array and its size)
    {
      {0, 4, 3, 5},
      {2, 3, 5, 5},
      {1, 4, 4, 5}
    };
