Before OOP

  -procedural programming
    -focus is on processes or actions that a program takes
    -programs are typically a collection of functions
    -data is declared separately
    -data is passed as arguments into functions
    -fairly easy to learn

  -procedural programming limitations
    -functions need to know the structure of the data
      -if the structure of the data changes many functions must be changed
    -As programs get larger they become more:
      -difficult to understand
      -difficult to maintain
      -difficult to extend
      -difficult to debug
      -difficult to reuse code
      -fragile and easier to break

----------------------------------------------------------------------
What is OOP?
  
  Classes and objects
    -Focus is on classes that model real-world domain entities
    -Allows developers to think at a higher level of abstraction
    -Used succesfully in very large programs
  
  Encapsulation
    -Objects contain data AND operations that work on that data
    -Abstract Data Type (ADT)

  Information-hiding
    -Implementations-specific logic can be hidden
    -Users of the class code the interface since they don't need to know the implementation
    -More abstraction
    -Easier to text, debug, maintain and extend

  Reusability
    -Easier to reuse classes in other applications
    -Faster development
    -Higher quality

  Inheritance
    -Can create new classes in term of existing classes
    -Reusability
    -Polymorphic classes

  -Polymorphism and more...

------------------------------------------------------------------------
Limitations
  
  -Not a panacea
    -OOP won't make bad code better
    -Not suitable for all types of problems
    -Not everything decomposes to a class

  -learning curve
    -Usually a steeper learning curve, especially for C++
    -Many OOP languages, many variations of OOP concepts

  -Design
    -Usually more up-front design is necessary to create good models and hierarchies

  -Programs can be:
    -Larger in size
    -Slower
    -More complex
