Struct vs classes
  
  -In addition to define a class we can declare a struct
  -Struct comes from the C programing language
  -Essentially the same as a class expect
    -members are public by default

--------------------------------------------------------
e.g.
  class Person {
    std::string name;
    std::string get_name();
  };

  Person p;
  p.name = "Frank"; //Compile error - private
  std::cout << p.get_name(); //compiler error - private

  -------------
  struct Person {
    std::string name;
    std::string get_name(); //Why if name is public?
  };

  Person p;
  p.name = "Frank"; //OK - public
  std::cout << p.get_name(); //OK - public

-------------------------------------------------------
Thats basically the main difference about classes and structs
Some general guideline to know what to use are the next:
  
  -Struct
    -use struct for passive opbjects with public access
    -Don't declare methods in struct

  -class
    -use class for active objects with private access
    -implement getters/setters as needed
    -implement member methods as needed
