Continue:
  -no further statements in the body of the loop are executed
  -control immediately goes directly to the beginning of the loop for the next iteration

Break:
  -no further statements in the body of the loop are executed
  -loop is immediately terminated
  -control immediately goes to the statement following the loop construct

e.g.
  vector<int> values {1, 2, -1, 3, -1, -99, 7, 8, 10};
  for (auto val: values) {
    if(val == -99)
      break; //if it hits -99 we are done and the loop breaks
    else if (val == 1)
      continue; //if we hit -1 the iteration stops at this point and continues 
                //to the next iteration
    else
      cout << val << endl;
  }

  Output:
    1
    2
    3
