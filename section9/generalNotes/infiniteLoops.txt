-Loops whose condition expression always evaluate to true
-Usually this is unintended and a programmer error
-Sometimes programmers use infinite loops and include break statements in the body to control them
-Sometimes infinite loops are exactly what we need
  -Event loop in an event-driven program
  -Operating systems

e.g.
  for(;;)
    cout << "This will print forever" << endl;

  while(true)
    cout << "This will print forever" << endl;

  do {
    cout << "This will print forever" << endl;
  } while (true);

  while(true) {
    char again {};
    cout << "Do you want to loop again? (Y/N): ";
    cin >> again;

    if(again == 'N' || again == 'n')
      break;
  }
