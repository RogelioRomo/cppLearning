  -for each element in a collection
  -while a specific condition remains true
  -until a specific condition becomes false

  -forever

Range-based for loop:
  -one iteration for each element in a range or collection

syntax:

    statement

comma operator:
  for(int i{1}, j{5}; i <=5; ++i, ++j) {
    cout << i << " * " << j << " : " << (i * j) << endl;
  }
