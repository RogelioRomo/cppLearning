Nested loops - Sum of the product of all pairs of vector elements

Given a vector of integers named vec that is provided for you, find the sum of the product o all pairs of vector elements. Youu should declare an integer variable named result and store the final product in this variable.

For example, given the vector vec to e {1,2,3}, the possible pairs are (1,2), (1,3) and (2,3). So the result would be (1*2) + (1*3) + (2*3) which is 11.

Another example:
Given the vector vec to be {2,4,6,8}, the possible pairs are (2,4), (2,6), (2,8), (4,6), (4,8), and (6,8). So the result would be (2*4) + (2*6) + (2*8) + (4*6) + (4*8) + (6*8) which is 140.

If the vector is empty or has only 1 element, then the result whould be 0
