Ranged-base for loop

  Syntax
    for(var_type var_name: sequence)
      statement;
  
  e.g.
    int score [] {100, 90, 97};
    for (int score: scores)
      cout << score << endl;

    output:
    100
    90
    97

You dont have to use explicitly the var_type, you can tell C++ to deduce/infered
The type of value it will have using the "auto" keyword:
  for(auto score: scores)
    cout << score << endl;

This will infered the type as integer for this case
